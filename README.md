# Hangman Project
### Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
The aim of this project is to implement and consolidate the python syntax and code we've used so far in the course.
The milestone_2.py file contains the code for the game written using vscode.
