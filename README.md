### Description
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where a random word is generated from a set list and the user tries to guess it. 
The aim of this project is to implement and consolidate the python syntax and code we've used so far in the course. The goal of
this project was to put together the code we've learned so far such as if - else statement, while loops, functions and putting
it all together following the object-oriented programming paradigm. 

### Installation
You need to have a version of python installed e.g. python 3 
Git clone :
